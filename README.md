Challenge for Module 4

As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district,
this analysis will help the school board and mayor to make strategic 
decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, the district-wide standardized test results will be 
analyzed. The data sets will include every student's math and reading 
scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 
The data will be aggregated to showcase obvious trends in school
performance.

This analysis is based on a dataset which is merged from two datsets: 
one based on school data and the other on student data.

A district-wide analysis of standardized test scores is done which shows 
the number of schools and students, the overall district budget, average 
math and reading scores, and passing rates for math, reading and overall 
combined.

Data is then grouped by individual schools and analyzed. Information of interest 
includes the school type, whether district or charter, school budget, budget per 
student, average math and reading scores and percentages of students passing math, 
reading, and both, overall.

Observed are the highest and lowest performing schools in the district, based on 
overall passing percentage rates. Data was also broken out to see the reading and
math scores for 9th, 10th, 11th,  and 12th grades per individual schools. Passing 
scores were observed with respect to individual school spending, school size, and 
school type.

This script is intended to exercise Pandas DataFrame manipulation from Module 4.
